# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I think Im at the level where Id want to do something with pygame or gbstudio, not entirely sure what but maybe something Pokemon based where its just a turn based battle sim
Maybe like a sound/music visualizer where you can pick an audio file and then it'll make one of those sound wave visuals 
The hardware stuff interested me aswell as a project involving music and I don't know if this is above my skill level but maybe something that is kind of a recreation of Shazam where I have a microphone detect audio then scan the web to find the song. I don't know if that goes against the project as it would just be remaking something that already exists but being able to do something like that interest me 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Where can you find these hardware components such as raspberry pis/ how long do they usually take to be delivered?
