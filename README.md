# 1051-Final-Project
What I learned and what I found to be difficult came from the same reasoning. My whole project was based on learning how to use GBStudio so just about everything about this project was something new I leaned. Another thing being creation of sprites as that was something I have never done before. 
The main difficulties were one it took me forever to figure out how to make a larger than 160by144 game world which prevented me from getting it started right away. Sprite sizes were difficult at first I wasnt really getting the translation in size but ended up figuring out. Im not sure this is my fault but one thing I couldnt figure out was how to prevent lag spikes with multiple enemies on the screen. There is a section where you have to jump between 2 enemies at once and the game slows down so much with them both visible. Not sure if it was my fault or just an issue with the engine but my efforts to fix it didnt do much. 
I found making enemies and the sprites of the world to be a lot of fun. Making a game that really feels like yours is a cool feeling and I think Ill likely make more projects in GBStudio in the future.
